        <h3>
            I'm a creative, design-oriented web developer striving to make life easier by creating simple &amp; exciting web applications.
            My background in external relations and public policy led me to find enjoyment in working in a team to craft
            practical solutions for complex problems. Constantly inspired by the people around me and the places Iâ€™ve been,
            I want to create things that will make a positive impact on the world.
        </h3>

            When I'm not coding I'm probably either dreaming about San Diego, playing PS4 with a bowl of salty caramel ice cream, trying
            to convince my friends that Cleveland isn't that bad of a city, keeping up with the Cavs, or pretending like
            I'm a professional photographer on Instagram.
